2010,2009,1,0,0,Actor in a Leading Role,"Oh! Thank you, Academy members! Mom and Dad, yeah, look! Whoo! Thank you, Mom and Dad, for turning me on to such a groovy profession. Oh, my dad, my mom, they loved show biz so much. I remember my mom getting all of us kids to entertain at her parties, you know, my dad sitting me on his bed and teaching me all of the basics of acting for a role in ""Sea Hunt."" They loved show biz so much and I feel an extension of them, you know, this is honoring them as much as it is me. I wanna thank Scott Cooper, our wonderful director, for his knowledge of film and country music, and for his ability to instill self-confidence in his actors. I thank you for that, Scott. Where are you? Raise your hand, man. Yeah! Scotty! Thank you for that, Scott man! And thank you for assembling such a wonderful cast. Maggie Gyllenhaal, Colin, wherever he is backstage, and Bobby Duvall. So wonderful, you guys brought your heart and soul. I want to thank Barry Markowitz, our wonderful DP, did such a brilliant job. Judy Cairo, our producer, and Fox Searchlight, our wonderful distributor. Thank you, guys, for keeping us all together and for making it all happen. T Bone Burnett and Stephen Bruton, for bringing all of that great music and those wonderful musicians to the party, man. And my wonderful team that's kept me together: Jean Sievers, David Schiff, Rick Kurtzman at CAA, Bob Wallerstein, Loyd Catlett, Tarra Day and Roger Love, man. Thank you, guys. And I especially want to thank my gorgeous wife, Sue. We've been married thirty-three years. We have a beautiful family, three girls: Isabelle, Jessie and Hayley. Thank you, guys. I wouldn't be up here without you. Thank you so much."
2010,2009,1,0,0,Actor in a Supporting Role,"Oscar and Penélope, that's an über bingo. I always wanted to discover some new continent and I thought I had to go this way. And then I was introduced to Quentin Tarantino who was putting together an expedition that was equipped by Harvey Weinstein and Lawrence Bender and David Linde. And he put this script in front of me and he said, ""This is where we're going, but we're going the other way."" So Brad Pitt helped me on board and Diane Kruger was there. And Mélanie Laurent and Denis Menochet and Bob Richardson, Sally Menke, and Adam Schweitzer and Lisa Kasteler. And everybody helped me find a place. Universal and The Weinstein Company and ICM. And Quentin, with his unorthodox methods of navigation, this fearless explorer took this ship across and brought it in with flying colors. And that's why I'm here. And this is your welcoming embrace, and there's no way I can ever thank you enough. But I can start right now: Thank you."
2010,2009,1,1,0,Actress in a Leading Role,"Did I really earn this or did I just wear you all down? I would like to thank the Academy for allowing me in the last month to have the most incredible ride, with rooms full of artists that I see tonight and that I've worked with before and I hope to work with in the future, who inspire me and blaze trails for us. Four of them, that I've fallen deeply in love with, I share this night with and I share this award with. Gabby, I love you so much. You are exquisite. You are beyond words to me. Carey, your grace and your elegance and your beauty and your talent makes me sick. Helen, I feel like we are family, through(?) family, and I don't have the words to express just what I think of you. And Meryl, you know what I think of you, and you are such a good kisser. I have so many people to thank for my good fortune in this lifetime, and this is a once-in-a-lifetime experience, I know. To the family that allowed me to play them, the Tuohy family. I know they're in here and you'll probably hear her in a minute... Maybe not. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to the family that made this film, that gave me the opportunity to do something different: John Lee Hancock, Gil Netter, Alcon, Warner Bros., the actors. Everyone who's shown me kindness when it wasn't fashionable, I thank you. To everyone who was mean to me when it wasn't... like George Clooney threw me in a pool years ago. I'm still holding a grudge. But there's so many people to thank; not enough time. So I would like to thank what this film was about for me, which are the moms that take care of the babies and the children no matter where they come from. Those moms and parents never get thanked. I, in particular, failed to thank one. So... if I can take this moment to thank Helga B. for not letting me ride in cars with boys till I was eighteen, 'cause she was right; I would've done what she said I was gonna do. For making me practice every day when I got home, piano, ballet, whatever it is I wanted to be. She said to be an artist you had to practice every day. And for reminding her daughters that there's no race, no religion, no class system, no color, nothing, no sexual orientation, that makes us better than anyone else. We are all deserving of love. So, to that trailblazer who allowed me to have that, and this [referring to the Oscar], and this, I thank you so much for this opportunity that I share with these extraordinary women, and my lover Meryl Streep. Thank you."
2010,2009,1,1,0,Actress in a Supporting Role,"First, I would like to thank the Academy for showing that it can be about the performance and not the politics. I want to thank Miss Hattie McDaniel for enduring all that she had to so that I would not have to. Tyler Perry and Oprah Winfrey, because you touched it the whole world saw it. Ricky Anderson, our attorney of Anderson & Smith, thank you for your hard work. My entire BET family, my ""Precious"" family, thank you so much. To my amazing husband Sidney, thank you for showing me that sometimes you have to forgo doing what's popular in order to do what's right. And baby, you were so right. God bless us all."
2010,2009,0,0,0,Animated Feature Film,"Boy, never did I dream that making a flip book out of my third grade math book would lead to this. Boy. It's incredible being here. It's just me right now, but please picture this whole stage full of the most amazing cast and crew you've ever experienced. Jonas Rivera, producer, Bob Peterson, co-director, you guys should all be up here with me. Thanks so much to Disney and to Pixar Animation Studios for believing in this oddball film. It was an incredible, incredible adventure making this movie, but the heart of it came from home. And to our families, in my case my wonderful parents, they were so supportive, my kids, Nicholas and Ellie, and my amazing wife Amanda, you guys are the greatest adventure. Thank you."
2010,2009,0,0,0,Art Direction,"Jim Cameron, this Oscar sees you. Clearly. Your vision is so deep. You know, thirteen years ago, doctors told me I wasn't going to survive, and I thought that this dream of standing here would never come true. And here we are. I owe this to my amazing wife Lizz, my two kids, Reece* and Remi*, for supporting me. Brooke Breton, Rick Carter and the hundreds of people that it took to make this film, thank you. Special thanks to Jon Landau. Jim, every day we went to work we knew we were working with a genius. We really were. We all felt that. Thank you so much."
2010,2009,0,0,0,Cinematography,"First of all, I want to thank the Academy for this unbelievable honor. It's a pleasure to be here. I want to thank the visionary Jim Cameron for an amazing vision of the film. My parents, Lorenzo and Romilda, who came to this country with four suitcases and a dream. I want to thank everybody in Chicago, Omaha. I want to thank my crew, everybody in New Zealand. Un gran saluto all'Italia. Viva l'Italia! Un grande abbraccio! I think I forgot a bunch of other people. Jon Landau, Colin Wilson, my crew, everybody. Thank you very much. Incredible honor. Thank you."
2010,2009,0,1,0,Costume Design,"Wow. Well, I already have two of these, so I'm feeling greedy. I'd like to dedicate this one to the costume designers that don't do movies about dead monarchs or glittery musicals. The designers that do the contemporary films and the low-budget ones that actually don't get as recognized, and they should do and they work as hard. So this is for you, but I'm gonna take it home tonight. Thank you."
2010,2009,0,1,0,Directing,"This really is, um, there's no other way to describe it, it's the moment of a lifetime. First of all, this is so extraordinary to be in the company of such powerful, my fellow nominees, such powerful filmmakers who have inspired me and I have admired for, some of whom, for decades. And thank you to every member of the Academy. This is, again, the moment of a lifetime. I would not be standing here if it wasn't for Mark Boal, who risked his life for the words on the page and wrote such a courageous screenplay. That I was fortunate enough to have an extraordinary cast bring that screenplay to life in Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty. And, I think the secret to directing is collaborating and I had truly an extraordinary group of collaborators in my crew: Barry Ackroyd, and Kalle Júlíusson, and Bob Murawski, Chris Innis, Ray Beckett, Richard Stutsman. And if I could just also thank my producing partners in Greg Shapiro and Nick Chartier, and my wonderful agent Brian Siberell. And the people of Jordan, who were such a... so hospitable to us when we were shooting. And I'd just like to dedicate this to the women and men in the military who risk their lives on a daily basis in Iraq and Afghanistan and around the world. And may they come home safe. Thank you."
2010,2009,0,0,1,Documentary (Feature),"Hello, everybody. I just want to say it was an honor to work on this film, and to try to make an entertaining film that also tries to enlighten everybody. I have to thank Jim Clark, who financed the film and was also kind of the guiding wisdom behind the film. Paula DuPré Pesmen, my producing partner. And my hero, Ric O'Barry, who is not only a hero to this species, but to all species. And the man who came up with the idea, Louie Psihoyos. Thank you..."
2010,2009,0,0,0,Documentary (Short Subject),"Oh my god. This is amazing. Two years ago when I got on an airplane and went to Zimbabwe, I never imagined in my wildest dreams that I'd end up here. This is so exciting—And Prudence, who is here, who is back there tonight. Prudence is here tonight. This is for Prudence."
2010,2009,0,1,0,Documentary (Short Subject),"Don't you like that the man never lets the woman talk. Isn't that just the classic thing? You know, in a world in which most of us are told and tell ourselves that we can't, Liyana, the band behind this film, teaches us that we're wrong. Against all odds, they did, so we can. So the bottom line is, to me, my role models and my heroes: Marvelous, and Energy, Tapiwa, Goodwell, the whole rest of the band, and especially Prudence."
2010,2009,0,0,0,Film Editing,"Wow, this is definitely the night to be here: a tribute to horror films, and Roger Corman. It's unbelievable. And my wife. My mom, who's here in the audience, and Chris's sister. And thank you to the Academy for giving this award to a movie that was made without compromise. We didn't have any preview screenings or focus groups or studio notes. Everybody made the movie we wanted to make and it turned out great, so I'm glad everybody liked it. Thank you."
2010,2009,0,1,0,Film Editing,"Thanks to my co-editor, Bob Murawski, my amazing husband. And to Sam Raimi, who gave us both our first cutting jobs.

2010,2009,0,0,1,Foreign Language Film,"It is on behalf of a crew and cast that, comprised mostly of people that I love and that are very close to my heart, that I want to thank the Academy for not considering Na'vi a foreign language, first of all. And for letting us spend three great days in the company of incredible filmmakers. On a personal note, I would love to thank my producers Gerardo Herrero, Mariela Besuievsky, Vanessa Ragone, Axel Kuschevatzky and Telefe. Tom Bernard... Sorry. In English it's more difficult, it's a little slower. No! No! Oh, countdown...oh, okay. Tom Bernard and Michael Barker from Sony Classics. And Cecilia, you found a guy stuck in development hell and made something watchable out of him. Thank you so much. I love you. I owe you. What, do I...? Please wrap up. How...? Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Vamos Argentina y un abrazo a los hermanos de Chile."
2010,2009,0,1,0,Makeup,"I don't want to step on your tail. It's hard to follow that face. We thank you, the Academy. We thank J.J. Abrams. Your vision inspired us, your energy kept us going, and your insistence on perfection brought us here. We thank Bad Robot, Paramount Pictures; we felt your support every day. We had an amazing staff of artists, over forty. We share this with you and we'll be giving your names backstage at that backstage Thank You Cam. Thank you very much."
2010,2009,0,0,0,Makeup,"Happy anniversary, baby."
2010,2009,0,0,0,Music (Original Score),"Thank you, guys. When I was... I was nine and I asked my dad, ""Can I have your movie camera? That old, wind-up 8mm camera that was in your drawer?"" And he goes, ""Sure, take it."" And I took it and I started making movies with it and I started being as creative as I could, and never once in my life did my parents ever say, ""What you're doing is a waste of time."" Never. And I grew up, I had teachers, I had colleagues, I had people that I worked with all through my life who always told me what you're doing is not a waste of time. So that was normal to me that it was okay to do that. I know there are kids out there that don't have that support system, so if you're out there and you're listening, listen to me: If you want to be creative, get out there and do it; it's not a waste of time. Do it. Okay? Thank you. Thank you."
2010,2009,0,0,0,Music (Original Song),"Thank you so much. I'd like to thank my wife Anna. I love you more than rainbows, baby. My uncle Clay, my band, Jack Whigham. Scott Cooper, the cast of ""Crazy Heart"": Jeff and Maggie and Colin and Mr. Bob. Everyone at Fox Searchlight. And Mr. T Bone Burnett and Stephen Bruton. Thank you all so much. Thank you. Thank you."
2010,2009,0,1,0,Best Picture,"I was just gonna reiterate that with Rob and Patrick, who took a very brave shot with this movie, and we owe them dearly. And perhaps one more dedication: To men and women all over the world who, sorry to reiterate, but wear a uniform. But even not just the military – hazmat, emergency, firemen. You know, they're there for us and we're there for them. Thank you. Thank you."
2010,2009,0,0,0,Best Picture,"Thank you so much. This has been such a dream, beyond a dream, for all of us who have lived for so long with this story. And, you know, we had this fantasy of making our film our way with the talent that we hoped to have, and hopefully we would find a distributor and somebody might even like the movie. So to be standing here, this was really, truly, honestly never part of anything we even imagined in our wildest dreams. So thank you so much to each and every member of the Academy for really honoring us beyond anything we could've imagined. GREG SHAPIRO: Thank you to the Academy. This is really unreal and extremely humbling. We also have to thank our intrepid financier and fellow producer, Nicolas Chartier, who bet on this movie when no one else would. The incredible support that we got from CAA, particularly Joel Lubin, Roeg Sutherland, Brian Siberell. Our entire cast and crew, and our fearless director. Our fearless director. And also, we owe a deep debt of gratitude, by the way, to Summit Entertainment and Rob Friedman and Patrick Wachsberger for distributing this film. And thank you, Mom. I forgot to thank you before."
2010,2009,0,0,0,Short Film (Animated),"Good evening. It doesn't look like, but it's a French film. Sorry about the accent. I'm the producer of the film, so I have to thank the three thousand non-official sponsors that appeared in the film. And I have to assure them that no logos were harmed during the making of the project. This award has to be shared with the incredible people who made the film, all the team, and especially the three directors that are with us in the theater tonight: François Alaux, Hervé de Crécy and Ludovic Houplain. You can applaud them, the directors. Thanks for them. They have been working for a very, very long time on this film. It took, like, six years to make this sixteen minutes, so I hope to come back here with a long feature film in about thirty-six years. Thank you very much. Bon soir."
2010,2009,0,0,1,Short Film (Live Action),"Whoa. I just don't know if I should dance or if I should.... Well, it's pretty much amazing and I just want to say thanks to everybody who's been on this project, and to actually a beautiful cast, and my producer Tivi. And it's pretty much...a ride, I must say. I can't say anything else, but I just want to thank Sam Bisbee, Jackie Kelman and Russell Icke. I hope you guys are watching. Edelman, Pawel Edelman, beautiful. But anyway, thank you very much for everything."
2010,2009,0,0,0,Sound Editing,"This is such a great honor to be here. Twenty-three years ago, other side of the world, I sold everything I had to come and be part of what you guys do over here. It's such a great honor. There's so many people have faith in me and gave me a shot, maybe when, I don't know that I earned it yet. And thank you to all those people. My wife and my son, for always loving me no matter what. And Kathryn, what an incredible movie. Thank you for everything and your friendship. All of you, the Academy, thank you so much."

This is the crowning achievement of my career. Thank you to Kathryn, the whole production team. Thank you to my team in Jordan, Simon Bysshe and Baha Othman. And thank you all. Thank you."
2010,2009,0,0,0,Visual Effects,"Thank you on behalf of all of us here. ""Avatar"" is a film about learning to see the world in new ways, and for that extraordinary inspiration I have to thank our director James Cameron. Jim, it was an honor to work with you on this. It was amazing. Also, Jon Landau. Jon, you were such a champion of the film. Thank you very much for that. Everyone at Lightstorm who was so helpful; Eileen Moran and everyone at Weta Digital for your talent and creativity; John Kilkenny; all of our friends at Fox. Sam Worthington, Zoë Saldana, Sigourney Weaver, all of our great cast, thank you for trusting us with your performances. I know that couldn't have been easy. To everyone watching, thank you for the great appreciation you've shown for our film. And just remember, the world that we live in is just as amazing as the one we created for you. Thank you."
2010,2009,0,0,0,Writing (Adapted Screenplay),"Don't know what to say. This is for everybody who works on a dream every day. Precious boys and girls everywhere. All the cast and crew, anyone who's kept believing in me. My two brothers, supported me in every way, my role models, my heroes, Buddy and Todd. My mother Bettye, angel of my world. My father Alphonse, who spent so much time with us and taught us everything. I'm sorry I'm drawing a blank right now, but I thank everyone."
2010,2009,0,0,0,Writing (Original Screenplay),"Oh my god. Wow. Thank you, Academy. You honor me and humble me with this more than, more than you know. I was a reporter back from Iraq with the idea for a story about these men on the frontlines of an unpopular war. I thought it might make a movie. The result wildly exceeded my expectations, and that is thanks to so many people. To Summit Entertainment. To our amazing cast and crew. And most of all, to one extraordinary individual and visionary filmmaker, Kathryn Bigelow. This belongs to you. I would also like to thank and dedicate this to the troops: The hundred and fifteen thousand who are still in Iraq, the hundred and twenty thousand in Afghanistan, and the more than thirty thousand wounded and four thousand who have not made it home. And to my father who didn't live to see this, but inspired me and got me up here. He passed away a month ago. He would've really liked this a lot. Thanks, Dad. Thank you."
2011,2010,1,0,0,Actor in a Leading Role,"I have a feeling my career has just peaked. My deepest thanks to the Academy. I'm afraid I have to warn you that I'm experiencing stirrings, somewhere in the upper abdominals, which are threatening to form themselves into dance moves which, joyous as they may be for me, it would be extremely problematic if they make it to my legs before I get offstage. So I'm going to do my best to be brief with my gratitude. First, for being on this extraordinary list of fellow nominees; something quite formidable and possibly the greatest honor of this. All the crew and my fellow cast members, those who are not here and those who are. Geoffrey, Helena, and Guy, whose virtuosity made it very, very difficult for me to be as bad as I was planning to be. And David Seidler, whose own struggles have given so many people the benefit of his very beautiful voice, and Tom Hooper, for the immense courage and clear sightedness with which he interpreted that. The men who finessed this to the screen: Gareth, Emile, Iain, Xavier, and of course Harvey, who first took me on twenty years ago when I was a mere child sensation. And all the people who have been rooting for me back home. Also Jessica Kolstad, my friend, Paul Lyon-Maris and Chris Andrews, for bearing with me through some of the less fortunate moments as well as the good ones. And my very fortunate friendship with Tom Ford who, to whom I owe a very big piece of this. And to the Anglo-Italian-American-Canadian axis which makes up my family. And Livia, for putting up with my fleeting delusions of royalty and who I hold responsible for this, and for really everything that's good that's happened since I met her. Now, if you'll all excuse me I have some impulses I have to tend to backstage. Thank you very much [unintelligible]."
2011,2010,1,0,0,Actor in a Supporting Role,"Bloody hell. Wow. What a roomful of talented and inspirational people and what the hell am I doing here in the midst of you? It's such an honor. David O. Russell, what a great spirit, you know, on the set. Just, just fantastic. And thank you so much, mate, for making the work that all of us actors did actually mean something, you know? I mean, that's the director's job of translating it to the audience and making it mean something. Thank you for that. Thank you to Pamela Martin, likewise, as our editor. The just incredible work of every actor. Melissa – I'm not gonna drop the f-bomb like she did; I've done that plenty before – Amy, Jack, Mark, man, you know the guy who just got this whole thing going right from the get go. Everybody in Lowell, all the actors from there. Dicky and Micky. Where's my quacker? Is he up there? Dicky's up there somewhere, mate. [Dicky Eklund stands up and waves from the audience.] Eh, mate, you're the best! You're the best. I can't wait – and listen, he's had a wonderful story and I can't wait to see the next chapter of his story, you know? If you wanna, if you wanna be a champ, if you wanna get trained with him, go meet with him. Dickeklund.com. Go do it. Check him out, okay. Alright. He deserves it. Our producers: Mark, David, Todd, incredible. Relativity and Paramount, for just pushing this out there and letting people know it exists. So many movies are just brilliant but nobody ever knows about them, you know? So we're so lucky to be here tonight and have people recognize that. My team, led by Patrick and Boomer and Carlos and Jen and Anna and Julie, thank you so much for everything you do. And of course, mostly, my wonderful wife... [chokes up] I didn't think I was like this! [Unintelligible] my wonderful wife, who's my mast through the storms of life. I hope I'm likewise to you, darling, and our little girl who's taught me so much more than I'll ever be able to teach her. Thank you. Thank you so much."
2011,2010,1,1,0,Actress in a Leading Role,"Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you so much to the Academy. This is insane and I truly, sincerely wish that the prize tonight was to get to work with my fellow nominees. I'm so in awe of you. I am so grateful to get to do the job that I do. I love it so much. I want to thank my parents, who are right there, first and foremost for giving me my life and for giving me the opportunity to work from such an early age, and showing me every day how to be a good human being by example. And I want to thank my team who works with me every day. Aleen Keshishian, my manager for eighteen years. And my agents, Kevin Huvane and everyone at CAA. Bryna and Tamar at I/D. My friends, who are everything to me no matter what's going on in my career. And everyone who's ever hired me: Luc Besson, who gave me my first job when I was eleven years old; Mike Nichols, who has been my hero and my champion for the past decade; and now Darren Aronofsky. You are a fearless leader, a visionary. I am blessed to have just gotten to get to work with you every day for the period of time we did. So many people helped me prepare for this role. Mary Helen Bowers spent a year with me, training me. Michelle Rodriguez, and Kurt Froman, and Olga Kostritzky, Marina Stavitskaya, and my beautiful love, Benjamin Millepied, who choreographed the film and has now given me my most important role of my life. And also there are people on films that no one ever talks about that are your heart and soul every day. Margie and Geordie, who did my hair and makeup; Nicci, who dressed me; and Kate and Laura Mulleavy, who designed the beautiful ballet costumes. Joe Reidy, our incredible AD, first AD. And our camera operators, J.C. and Steve, you gave me so much soul behind the camera every day and you gave me all of your energy. Most importantly, my family, my friends, and my love. Thank you so much."
2011,2010,1,1,0,Actress in a Supporting Role,"Oh my! Oh my god! Oh wow! Really, really, really, really, really, truly wow. I know there's a lot of people that said a lotta real, real nice things to me for several months now, but I'm just shakin' in my boots here. Okay, alright. Thank you, David O. Russell. I want to thank the actors: Mark Wahlberg; Christian Bale – he might've run out for a second; Amy, my sweet sister Adams; Jack; our lovely daughters. Okay... yeah, I am kind of speechless. Golly sakes, there's people up there, too [waving to the balcony sections]. When I watched Kate two years ago it looked so fuckin easy – oops! Alice Ward, your beautiful family that opened your hearts. I saw Mick here earlier. Dick, shout out for Nana? Alright, Dick's not in the room. Thank you so much, opening your hearts to all of us to make this film. I thanked David, I'll thank him again. My family, my beautiful son who's traveling right now in South America and can't join me. It's okay; I'm okay, Jack. My mom and my dad, and my brother, and my friends, and my family. And I wanna thank the very most of all, the Academy of Motion Picture Sciences, their board of governors and all their members, whom many of you are here today. This has been an extraordinary journey in getting to know what the Academy is about, and first and foremost, thank you, Academy. Because it's about sellin' motion pictures and respecting the work! Thank you so much!"
2011,2010,0,0,0,Animated Feature Film,"Oh boy. I can't believe I'm actually saying this, but thank you to the Academy. I wouldn't be standing here if it weren't for the vision of three incredible guys: John Lasseter, Ed Catmull and Steve Jobs, the founders of Pixar Animation Studios which, by the way, is the most awesome place on the planet to make movies! To my producer Darla Anderson, screenwriter Michael Arndt, my cast and crew, everyone at Disney and Pixar, every single person who had absolutely anything to do with making ""Toy Story 3"" and getting it out into the world, I share this with you. To my grandmother, who always insisted that she'd see me up here someday. To my parents, my wife Laura, my kids, Hannah, Alice and Max, I love you all so much. And finally, thank you to audiences all over the world who came out in historic numbers and embraced a movie about talking toys that hopefully had something very human to say. Thank you. Thank you! Thank you!"

Everyone at Disney, from Iger and Ross and Bailey, Bruce Hendricks, Art Repola, the great Joe Roth. The art department led by Stefan Dechant, Christy Wilson, and Todd Cherniawsky. This great set decorator [putting his arm around O'Hara]. I'm standing here because of three people: Ken Ralston, the great Richard Zanuck, and the wacky world of Tim Burton. There he is! Meet me with a saw because half of this is yours. There's just one last bit of art direction for a Tim Burton film [puts a miniature ""Mad Hatter"" wig and hat on his Oscar]... and there it is.

Thank you to the Academy for this great honor and for the respect that you've shown for all cinematographers. Ahh, I've got to take a breath here for a minute; breathe it in for a second. Where's that thing that shows you how much time you have; oh there it goes! Okay, anyway, none of what I did would have been possible without the incredible vision of my master, Christopher Nolan. His work [applause]... you're taking up my time! [laughs] His work has inspired me for twelve years and continues to. He's a brilliant filmmaker as we all know. Much thanks to Emma Nolan, to Warner Bros., to my fantastic union crew. And to my family: Anna, Nick, Claire, Mia, and to my mom and dad. Thanks so much!"
2011,2010,0,1,0,Costume Design,"Thank you to the Academy and especially to my fellow nominees who are just so much fun to sit with at the, tonight and have been so supportive. It's great to be part of such a great group of people. The story ""Alice in Wonderland"" was described by its publisher in 1865 as a story valued for its rare imagination, priceless humor, and power to transport the reader into a world of pure fantasy; a gift to us all. The heart of any movie lies with the director and I've been incredibly lucky on this and many films to work with the singular Tim Burton. Tim's imagination along with the amazing cast – Johnny's incandescent ""Hatter,"" Mia's ""Alice"" for all girls all times, Helena's the fearless, big-headed queen, and our crystalline snowflake princess Anne Hathaway – made my job a delight. We had the support of a production team headed by Richard Zanuck and Katterli Frauenfelder, supported by Joe Roth, Suzanne and Jen Todd, and Disney, but I couldn't have done it without my team: Christine Cantella and my entire group. Thank you all very much."

Your work this year has been extraordinary and I'm honored to be nominated alongside you. Thank you to my wonderful actors. The triangle of man love, which is Colin Firth, Geoffrey Rush, and me. I'm only here because of you guys, and Helena, I hope that reference doesn't make you too jealous. Thank you to all my cast; to my wonderful crew; to my producers, Iain, Gareth, Emile; to David Seidler, whose extraordinary journey from childhood stammerer to the stage of the Kodak I find so profoundly moving. But most of all, thank you to my parents, my mum and dad who are in the audience tonight. And I know there's been a lot of thanking of mums, but this is slightly different because my mum in 2007 was invited by some Australian friends—she's Australian—in London to a fringe theater play reading of an unproduced, unrehearsed play called ""The King's Speech."" Now she's never been invited to a play reading in her entire life before. She almost didn't go because it didn't sound exactly promising, but thank god she did because she came home, rang me up and said, ""Tom, I think I found your next film."" So with this [holding up the Oscar] tonight, I honor you. And the moral of the story is: Listen to your mother."

At the Academy, at the lunch they have for the nominees, where they have like a Randy Newman chicken by this time, the, Mr. Mischer said that it's not really good television to take a list out of your pocket and thank a lot of people. It's not my style anyway, but it is in this case. I mean, to have worked for Pixar doing the six pictures I've done, on this one Lee Unkrich and worked with Mitchell Froom, Chris Montan at Disney. I just have to thank these people. I don't want to; I want to be good television so badly, as you can see. I've been on this show any number of times and I've slowed it down almost every time. No wonder they, they only nominate four songs? There's not one—what about cinematography? It says five, you know. You could find a fifth song from someone. But hell with it! I thank—it might have beat me. Anyway, I thank you all very much for this. The Academy has been enormously kind to me as has the Music Branch. And I love you all. Thank you very much."

It's impossible to describe what it feels like to be handed the same award that was given to Paddy Chayefsky thirty-five years ago for another movie with ""network"" in the title. His was an original screenplay; this is an adaptation of a book by Ben Mezrich, so I'm accepting this on his behalf as well. There are a lot of people who've worked hard in my corner for a long time and it seems like the right moment to thank them: my assistant Lauren Lohman; my researcher Ian Reichbach; my long suffering press rep, Joy Fehily, and all the women of Prime; Rich Heller, Bill Tanner, Andy Forshay*; my agents Ari Emanuel and Jason Spitz, who never blow my cover and reveal that I would happily do this for free; and my mom and dad, who made a life for me where I get to be a part of nights like this. I wrote this movie but David Fincher made this movie, and he did it with an ungodly artfulness. Someone this talented has no business being the nicest guy in the world, but he is, and he made the movie of any screenwriter's dreams. He had help from Amy Pascal, Michael Lynton and everyone at Sony whose only mandate was to make it good. From Dana Brunetti, Ceán Chaffin, Mike De Luca, and America's best living film producer, Scott Rudin. And from Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Justin Timberlake, Armie Hammer, Armie Hammer again, Rashida Jones, Rooney Mara, and a cast and crew that followed their leader's example: that good enough was never good enough. This movie is going to be a source of pride for me every day for the rest of my life. That is an un-repayable gift. All I can say is thank you. Roxy Sorkin, your father just won the Academy Award. I'm gonna have to insist on some respect from your guinea pig. Thank you very much."

And I would like to thank my producers, my director, my cast... there's so many people and they're saying wrap up now; I'm sorry.

But I haven’t forgotten who to thank. The Academy, of course, for this extraordinary honor and my fellow nominees: Kenneth, Nick, Jonah, dear Max, I’m so proud to be in your company. And of course I wouldn’t be here at all if it weren’t for Michael Mills and his enchanting film, “Beginners,” and my screen partner of course, Ewan McGregor, that superb artist, who I would happily share this award with if I had any decency, but I don’t.

Thank you so much. I just want to thank everybody who’s here tonight and everybody who isn’t and everybody who’s ever been born or may be born or be born again or reborn.

I really wouldn’t be here for not for the genius of Martin Scorsese. It’s an epic thrill to work on a movie with Marty and especially this particular movie and the incredible collaborators all of which are nominated here tonight. And by the grace of hundreds of artists all over the world working thousands and thousands of hours, we’re here standing up there and we appreciate that and we want to thank the Academy for recognizing them.

We also share it in particular with Kaui Hart Hemmings, our beautiful Hawaiian flower for her novel. And on a brief personal note if i may, my mother is here with me from Omaha. Hold the applause. And after watching the show a few years ago she made me promise that if I ever won another Oscar I had to dedicate it to her just like Javier Bardem did with his mother. So Mom, this one's for you.

2013,2012,1,0,0,Actor in a Leading Role,"I really don't know how any of this happened. I do know that I've received so much more than my fair share of good fortune in my life and I'm so grateful to the Academy for this beautiful honor. It's a strange thing because three years ago, before we decided to do a straight swap, I had actually been committed to play Margaret Thatcher... and Meryl was Steven's first choice for Lincoln. And I'd like to see that version. And Steven didn't have to persuade me to play Lincoln but I had to persuade him that perhaps, if I was going to do it, that ""Lincoln"" shouldn't be a musical. My fellow nominees, my equals, my betters, I'm so proud to have been included as one amongst you. When we got married sixteen years ago – or since we got married sixteen years ago – my wife Rebecca has lived with some very strange men. I mean they were strange as individuals and probably even stranger if taken as a group. But luckily she's the versatile one in the family and she's been the perfect companion to all of them. I'd like to thank Kathy Kennedy, our producer, and through you, Kathy... and through you, our mighty team of co-conspirators. At the apex of that human pyramid there are three men to whom I owe this and a great deal more: Tony Kushner; our beloved skipper Steven Spielberg; and the mysteriously beautiful mind, body and spirit of Abraham Lincoln. For my mother. Thank you so much."

I thank Harvey Weinstein and Amy Pascal, Stacey Sher, Reginald Hudlin and Pilar Savone. I thank Adam Schweitzer, Lisa Kasteler. And I thank my friends Jeff Dashnaw and Bill Clark who saved my neck. We participated in a hero's journey – the hero here being Quentin. And you scaled the mountain because you're not afraid of it. You slay the dragon because you're not afraid of it. And you cross through fire because it's worth it. I borrowed my character's words. Sorry; couldn't resist. Thank you."

Especially Steven and Kathy and Tony and Sally, but of course, Daniel, who actually convinced us that he was Lincoln.

There are literally thousands of people to thank, so thankfully I'm not gonna thank them now. I'm going to thank everybody personally in the next few weeks, but there are a couple of people I want to acknowledge. I want to acknowledge my partner in crime and my great friend, George Clooney, who... Everybody should be so lucky to have a partner who is as talented and as humorous and who has as much integrity. So, thank you, George. I want to thank my beautiful wife Lysa; you make everything better. And to our kids, Maya and Olivia, I love you guys. I hope your old man's not embarrassing you up here. The reason I wanted to speak first – I wanted to speak before Ben – was Ben is a producer on the film and he is also our director. And I thought it would be awkward for Ben to thank himself, but it's not awkward for me. So on behalf of George and myself, I want to thank you, Ben. You directed a hell of a film. Couldn't be more proud of the film; couldn't be more proud of Ben. So ladies and gentlemen, our co-producer and the director of ""Argo"": Ben Affleck. Thank you very much. Thank you very, very much. I know eventually that thing is gonna start to go, so forgive me if this is a little bit quick. I want to acknowledge Steven Spielberg, who I feel is a genius and a towering talent among us. I want to acknowledge the other eight films. There are eight great films that have every right, as much a right to be up here as we do. I want to acknowledge them and thank them for what they did, and for many of them who didn't even get nominated this year. I want to thank, you know, I mean, Jack McNiece*, and Jerry Speck*, and Marty Brest, and my brother, and my mom and dad, and Patrick Whitesell, and Tony Mendez, who let us do his story. Thank you. And I'm gonna forget – I thank everyone in the movie, on the movie, worked on the movie, did anything with this movie, gets thanked. I want to thank Canada. I want to thank our friends in Iran living in terrible circumstances right now. I want to thank my wife – who I don't normally associate with Iran, but... I want to thank you for working on our marriage for ten Christmases. It's good. It is work but it's the best kind of work, and there's no one I'd rather work with. And I just want to say, you know, I was here fifteen years ago or something, and, you know, I had no idea what I was doing. I stood out here in front of you all, really just a kid, and I went out, you know, and I never thought that I would be back here. And I am because of so many of you who are here tonight, because of this Academy, because of so many wonderful people who extended themselves to me when they had nothing to benefit from it in Hollywood. You know what I mean? I couldn't get 'em a job. I want to thank them and I want to thank what they taught me, which is that you have to work harder than you think you possibly can. You can't hold grudges. It's hard but you can't hold grudges. And it doesn't matter how you get knocked down in life, because that's gonna happen. All that matters is that you gotta get up.

That's the magic of visual effects. I want to thank Gil Netter and Elizabeth Gabler and all those at Fox and Fox 2000 for realizing that sometimes it takes a risk to make something special. And ""Life of Pi"" was a risk worth taking. To our director Ang Lee, you were an inspiration and you made it an incredible journey for all of us. Thank you. To David Womark, Mike Malone, and Tommy Fisher for making a wave tank that kept us from having to go out to the real ocean. And John Kilkenny, for inviting all of us to the party in the first place.

I actually think if people are like... knowing about my movies thirty or fifty years from now it's gonna be because of the characters that I created. And I really only got one chance to get it right. I have to cast the right people to make those characters come alive and hopefully live for a long time. And, boy, this time did I do it. Thank you so much, guys!

2014,2013,1,0,0,Actor in a Leading Role,"Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you to the Academy for this—all 6,000 members. Thank you to the other nominees. All these performances were impeccable in my opinion. I didn’t see a false note anywhere. I want to thank Jean-Marc Vallée, our director. Want to thank Jared Leto, Jennifer Garner, who I worked with daily. There’s a few things, about three things to my account that I need each day. One of them is something to look up to, another is something to look forward to, and another is someone to chase. Now, first off, I want to thank God. ‘Cause that’s who I look up to. He has graced my life with opportunities that I know are not of my hand or any other human hand. He has shown me that it’s a scientific fact that gratitude reciprocates. In the words of the late Charlie Laughton, who said, “When you’ve got God, you got a friend. And that friend is you.” To my family, that who and what I look forward to. To my father who, I know he’s up there right now with a big pot of gumbo. He’s got a lemon meringue pie over there. He’s probably in his underwear. And he’s got a cold can of Miller Lite and he’s dancing right now. To you, Dad, you taught me what it means to be a man. To my mother who’s here tonight, who taught me and my two older brothers… demanded that we respect ourselves. And what we in turn learned was that we were then better able to respect others. Thank you for that, Mama. To my wife, Camila, and my kids Levi, Vida and Mr. Stone, the courage and significance you give me every day I go out the door is unparalleled. You are the four people in my life that I want to make the most proud of me. Thank you. And to my hero. That’s who I chase. Now when I was 15 years old, I had a very important person in my life come to me and say “who’s your hero?” And I said, “I don’t know, I gotta think about that. Give me a couple of weeks.” I come back two weeks later, this person comes up and says “who’s your hero?” I said, “I thought about it. You know who it is? It’s me in 10 years.” So I turned 25. Ten years later, that same person comes to me and says, “So, are you a hero?” And I was like, “not even close. No, no, no.” She said, “Why?” I said, “Because my hero’s me at 35.” So you see every day, every week, every month and every year of my life, my hero’s always 10 years away. I’m never gonna be my hero. I’m not gonna attain that. I know I’m not, and that’s just fine with me because that keeps me with somebody to keep on chasing. So, to any of us, whatever those things are, whatever it is we look up to, whatever it is we look forward to, and whoever it is we’re chasing, to that I say, “Amen.” To that I say, “Alright, alright, alright.” To that I say “just keep living.” Thank you."

2014,2013,1,1,0,Actress in a Leading Role,"Sit down. You’re too old to be standing. Thank you, Mr. Day-Lewis, from you it exacerbates this honor to and it blows it right out of the ballpark. Thank you so much to the Academy. As random and as subjective as this award is, it means a great deal in a year of extraordinary, yet again, extraordinary performances by women. Amy Adams, everything you do, but your performance in American Hustle blew my mind. And Meryl, what can I say? Sandra, I could watch that performance to the end of time, and I sort of felt like I had. Julia, #suckit. You know what I mean? And Judi Dench, I mean what a career. She’s not here tonight because at the age of 79, her film was so successful that she’s in India doing a sequel. I mean what a career that is, if I could hope. And me, I’m here excepting an award in an extraordinary screenplay by Woody Allen. Thank you so much, Woody, for casting me. I truly appreciate it. I’m so very proud that Blue Jasmine stayed in the cinemas for as long as it did. And thank you to Sony Classics, to Michael and Tom for their extraordinary support. For so bravely and intelligently distributing the film and to the audiences who went to see it and perhaps those of us in the industry who are still foolishly clinging to the idea that female films with women at the center are niche experiences. They are not. Audiences want to see them and, in fact, they earn money. The world is round, people. Thank you to my mum, to my sister, to my brother, to my three glorious sons. I would not be standing here without you. To my husband, Andrew, you are a legend. Thank you to my agent, Hylda Queally, you’re behind the pillar somewhere up there. You are a goddess. To my agent in Australia, Robyn Gardiner, I love you so very much. To my publicist Lisa Kasteler. To the sublime Sally Hawkins. And to the extraordinary cast of Blue Jasmine. I don’t know how to do this with other actors and this I share with you. To the hair and makeup people who sweated me up and tried to make me look attractive. Thank you for the attempt. To Carla Meyer for getting Sally and I together and for incredible support. To Helen Robin. To everyone involved in Blue Jasmine, I thank you so much. And finally, I would like to thank every single member of the Sydney Theatre Company, one of the great theater companies in the world. For me, working on Blue Jasmine, it was a real synthesis of my work in the theater and on film. And not only working with you for the last six years has been the most enormous privilege of my career but it’s made me a better actress. There is so much talent in Australia and Michael Wilkinson and C.M. and I are just tonight’s tip of the iceberg. Thank you so much. Thank you."
2014,2013,1,1,0,Actress in a Supporting Role,"Yes! Thank you to the Academy for this incredible recognition. It doesn’t escape me for one moment that so much joy in my life is thanks to so much pain in someone else’s. And so I want to salute the spirit of Patsey for her guidance. And for Solomon, thank you for telling her story and your own. Steve McQueen, you charge everything you fashion with a breath of your own spirit. Thank you so much for putting me in this position. This has been the joy of my life. I’m certain that the dead are standing about you and watching and they are grateful and so am I. Chiwetel, thank you for your fearlessness and how deeply you went into telling Solomon’s story. Michael Fassbender, thank you so much. You were my rock. Alfre and Sarah, it was a thrill to work with you. Joe Walker, the invisible performer in the editing room, thank you. Sean Bobbitt, Kalaadevi, Adruitha, Patty Norris, thank you, thank you, thank you, I could not be here without your work. I want to thank my family for your training and the Yale School of Drama as well for your training. My friends, the Wilsons, this one’s for you. My brother, Junior, sitting by my side. Thank you so much. You are my best friend. And Ben, my other best friend, my chosen family. When I look down at this golden statue, may it remind me and every little child that no matter where you’re from your dreams are valid. Thank you."

I accept this award on behalf of the truly many technicians who fall under the umbrella of the art department. And believe you me, on Gatsby, there were many, many very talented technicians who worked on the film. I’d like to thank Karen Murphy, my associate production designer. Neither Bev nor I would be standing here if it wasn’t for you. Our supervising art director, Ian Gracie. You rock and you swear a lot.

Of course, I’d like to thank the Academy, but mainly I’d like to thank my incredible team. I have a group of ladies who are sewing for me right now in Sydney on a show we’re making of Baz’s first film, a musical. They’re my golden girls. They’ve been working with me for 25 years. They bring me such incredible luck. They’ll all be watching the TV right now and they know who they are. There are two people I have to thank very, very specially – Kerry Thompson and Silvana Azzi Heras and, of course, my incomparable husband, Baz Luhrmann, he makes it all possible. He dreams the dream."
2014,2013,0,0,0,Directing,"Wow, thank you. Thanks to the Academy. Like any other human endeavor, making a film can be a transformative experience, and I want to thank Gravity because for many of us involved in this film, it was definitely a transformative experience. And it’s good, because it took so long that if not, it would be like a waste of time. What really sucks is that for a lot of these people, that transformation was wisdom; for me, it was just the color of my hair. I want to share this with all these wise people who made this movie happen: my amazing son and co-writer Jonás Cuarón. Sandra Bullock. Sandy, you’re Gravity. You are the soul, the heart of the film. You’re the most amazing collaborator and one of the best people I ever met. George Clooney, for your absolute trust. David Heyman, Chivo and Tim Webber for making this film happen. The wise guys of Warner Bros., the wise people at Warner Bros., Kevin Tsujihara, Sue Kroll, [unintelligible], Greg Silverman, Lynn Harris, Chris De Faria.

And when I first met with him I remember he said, “I want to win an Oscar.” I remember thinking, “You’re crazy… that will NEVER happen.” Gil passed away just weeks before we premiered the film at Sundance. And tonight I know he’s celebrating with us along with his wife, Janet, and his son, Theo. I just want to thank my backup singers… my wife, Jennette, my kids, Sadie and Cameron.

2014,2013,0,0,0,Documentary (Short Subject),"Thank you. When I met Alice Sommer I was struck by two things, her extraordinary capacity for joy and her amazing capacity for forgiveness. For those of you who don’t know it, the amazing Alice Sommer died one week ago today. She was 110. She died quietly. And so this really is, and that (pointing to second Oscar), they’re both for Alice. She was a woman who taught everyone on my crew to be a little bit more optimistic and a little bit more happy about all the things that were happening in our lives and, see the film, she’ll help you live, I think, a much happier life. Thank you so much. Thank you, Nick. Thank you to the crew, Chris Branch, Phil Goldfine, Frederic, Tim, Kieran, [unintelligible] and Carl."
